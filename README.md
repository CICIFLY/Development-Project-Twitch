# Development-Project-Twitch

This is a full-stack project I took with Laioffer. 

During this course, I built a Personalized Twitch Resources Recommendation Engine

Users can use this application to search twitch resources (stream/video/clip) and get recommendations. 

For the front-end, I built a web page with rich user friendly experience using React and Ant Design;

IRESTful APIs was implemented using Java servlets;

Users can retrieve real Twitch resources using Twitch API and stored data in MySQL.

The application supports login/logout and favorite collection.

Multiple recommendation algorithms were explored by extracting game information from Twitch resources 

The service was deployed to AWS EC2 for better stability.
